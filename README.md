# Swarm

An experimental app to overwhelm an [escpos](https://www.epson-biz.com/modules/ref_escpos/)-compatible printer with a lot of data.

It prints ASCII-art version of numbers like `01`, `02`, etc, to help you see if anything was missed by the printer.

## Requirements

Xcode 13.2 or later and macOS Monterey

## Usage

Build and run the app in Xcode. Enter your printer's IP address.

Choose a number on the slider from 1 to 20 and press "Swarm".

Wait for the numbers to print out and verify that they all printed.

The numbers will most likely be out-of-order.
